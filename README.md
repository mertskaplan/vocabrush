# VocabRush: The Playful Word Party Game
VocabRush is a vibrant, mobile-first, offline-capable Progressive Web App (PWA) designed as a word-guessing party game. Inspired by classics like Taboo and Charades, it's built for fun, fast-paced team play. The entire application runs client-side with no server dependency, ensuring privacy and full offline functionality. The user experience is defined by a 'Kid Playful' art style, featuring bright colors, rounded shapes, and charming animations.
The game flow guides users through a simple setup process: selecting a language, choosing the number of teams (2-4), customizing team names and colors, and picking a word deck. The core gameplay consists of three distinct rounds, each with unique rules: 1) Free description, 2) One-word clues, and 3) Charades (acting only). Teams score points based on the difficulty of correctly guessed words within a 60-second timer. The game culminates in a final scoreboard celebrating the winning team.

## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager
### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mertskaplan/vocabrush.git
   cd vocabrush
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   bun install
   ```
3. **Run the development server:**
   ```sh
   bun run dev
   ```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port).
## üê≥ Running with Docker
If you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, you can easily build and run the application in a containerized environment.
1. **docker-composer.yml**
   ```
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     vocabrush:
       build:
         context: https://github.com/mertskaplan/vocabrush.git
         dockerfile: Dockerfile
       container_name: vocabrush
       ports:
         - "8622:80"
       restart: unless-stopped
   ```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:8622`.
## üìÅ Project Structure
The project follows a standard Vite + React structure with some key directories:
-   `public/`: Contains all static assets.
    -   `public/decks/`: JSON files for word decks (e.g., `animals.en.json`).
    -   `public/locales/`: JSON files for UI translations (e.g., `en.json`).
-   `src/`: Main application source code.
    -   `src/components/`: Reusable React components, including `shadcn/ui`.
    -   `src/pages/`: Top-level route components (views).
    -   `src/stores/`: Zustand stores for global state management.
    -   `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions.
-   `worker/`: Cloudflare Worker code for serving the application.
## üîß Development
### Available Scripts
-   `bun run dev`: Starts the local development server with hot-reloading.
-   `bun run build`: Bundles the application for production.
-   `bun run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
-   `bun run preview`: Serves the production build locally for testing.
### Adding New Content
-   **To add a new word deck:**
    1.  Create a new JSON file in `public/decks/` following the format `deck-name.lang.json`. The file must be self-contained with `id`, `name`, `language`, `count`, and a `words` array.
    2.  Add the new deck's filename to the `deckIds` array in `src/pages/SetupPage.tsx`.
-   **To add a new language:**
    1.  Create a new translation file in `public/locales/` (e.g., `es.json`).
    2.  Update the language selection UI in the `HomePage` component to include the new option.
